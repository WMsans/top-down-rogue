## Running tests (gdUnit4)

Tests run headless via the gdUnit4 command tool:

```bash
godot --headless --path . -s res://addons/gdUnit4/bin/GdUnitCmdTool.gd --ignoreHeadlessMode -a res://tests/test_card_view.gd
```

### Import the project first in fresh worktrees

The `.godot/` import cache is gitignored, so it is **not** shared across git
worktrees — each working tree needs its own. A newly created worktree has no
`.godot/`, and without it Godot can't resolve imported assets (textures, scenes,
`.uid` references), so test runs fail before any test executes.

Generate the cache once per worktree (idempotent and fast once it exists):

```bash
godot --headless --path . --import
```

To make a run self-contained, prepend the import step:

```bash
godot --headless --path . --import && \
godot --headless --path . -s res://addons/gdUnit4/bin/GdUnitCmdTool.gd --ignoreHeadlessMode -a res://tests/test_card_view.gd
```

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

When the user types `/graphify`, invoke the `skill` tool with `skill: "graphify"` before doing anything else.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- Dirty graphify-out/ files are expected after hooks or incremental updates; dirty graph files are not a reason to skip graphify. Only skip graphify if the task is about stale or incorrect graph output, or the user explicitly says not to use it.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
